First, sample 100 random values from a log-normal distribution (mu = 1, sigma = 0.25).
```{r}
set.seed(100) # Set seed: For reproducing the same results
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
summary(samples)

# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean  3rd Qu.   Max. 
#1.540   2.335   2.678   2.811   3.203   5.184

```

Second, create a histogram of the distribution on the log scale.
```{r}
log.samples <- log(samples) # Convert the data to a log scale

cat("Mean =", mean(log.samples), "\n", "Median =", median(log.samples), "\n", "SD =", sd(log.samples))
# Mean = 1.000728 
# Median = 0.985145 
# SD = 0.2551776

# Plot the histogram of the sample on a normal scale with a normal distribution overlay
hist(samples, freq = F, main = "The distribution of samples", xlab = "Sample values",ylab = "Frequency")
lines(density(samples),col = 'blue')

# Plot the histogram of the sample on a log scale with a normal distribution overlay
hist(log.samples, freq = F, ylim = c(0,2), main = "The distribution of samples (log scale)", xlab = "Log-scaled values", ylab = "Frequency")
lines(density(log.samples),col = 'blue')

```
