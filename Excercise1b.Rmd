-------
First, sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution (mu = 1, sigma = 0.25).
```{r}
set.seed(100) # Set seed: For reproducing the same results
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
print(samples)
```

Second, create a histogram of the distribution on the log scale.
```{r}
log.samples <- log(samples)
cat("Mean =", mean(log.samples), "\n", "Median =", median(log.samples), "\n", "SD =", sd(log.samples))
# Mean = 1.000728 
# Median = 0.985145 
# SD = 0.2551776

# Draw the histogram of the sample in a log scale
hist(log.samples, main = "Mean = 1, SD = 0.25", xlab = "Log-scaled values",ylab = "Frequency")

```
